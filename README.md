# From API to Queues

## Project Overview

**"From API to Queues"** is a comprehensive project that demonstrates how to integrate APIs with task queues using Celery, a powerful distributed task queue framework. This project showcases how to manage background tasks efficiently by decoupling time-consuming operations from the main application flow. The entire setup is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale.

## Directory Structure

Here's a breakdown of the key files and directories in the project:

### 1. **Celery Setup**
   - **`celery/`**: Contains the core Celery configuration and task definitions.
     - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the Celery app.
     - **`celeryconfig.py`**: Configuration file for the Celery application, defining broker URL, backend, and other Celery settings.
     - **`client.py`**: Provides a simple interface for sending tasks to the Celery worker from the API.
     - **`tasks.py`**: Defines the tasks that Celery workers will execute.

### 2. **Application Scripts**
   - **`backend_script.py`**: Script that handles backend processing tasks, which can be scheduled or triggered via the Celery queue.
   - **`broker_script.py`**: Manages the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) that communicates between the API and Celery workers.
   - **`demo.py`**: Demonstrates a complete workflow, from sending a task via the API to processing it with Celery.
   - **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the application, typically handling API requests and routing them to appropriate services.
   - **`table_script.py`**: Example script for handling database operations or tabular data processing within the task queue system.

### 3. **Docker and Deployment**
   - **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the Docker image setup for the application, including installation of dependencies and configuration of the environment.
   - **`docker-compose.yml`**: Provides a multi-container Docker setup, orchestrating the application, Celery worker, and message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Redis).

### 4. **Project Documentation**
   - **`README.md`**: This file, containing documentation for the project.
   - **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the application, including Celery, Flask (or another web framework), and other necessary libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/from-api-to-queues.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd from-api-to-queues
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Using Docker Compose

1. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. The application should now be running, and you can interact with it via the API or directly using the `demo.py` script.

#### Running Locally

1. Start the message broker (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ) required by Celery.
2. Start the Celery worker:
   ```bash
   celery -A celery worker --loglevel=info
   ```
3. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage

- **API Integration**: The `main.py` script handles API requests that can enqueue tasks using Celery.
- **Task Management**: The `client.py` and `tasks.py` in the `celery/` directory manage how tasks are sent to and processed by Celery workers.
- **Background Processing**: Use the `backend_script.py` and `table_script.py` for more complex processing tasks that run asynchronously.
